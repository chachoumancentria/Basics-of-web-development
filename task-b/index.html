        This is a very basic website. It doesn't have much purpose, but you can visit it if you want.
        There is nothing here, you are probably wasting your time if you are reading this. Anyways, here's what I like
        to do :

        <li>Videogames</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
    </ul>
