## Feedbacks
task-I : Excellent!
task-J : Good!
task-K : Error in validation: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fchachoumancentria.github.io%2FBasics-of-web-development%2Ftask-k%2F
          Responsiveness is lacking — elements become uneven in width when the viewport is reduced.

## What we changed
Considering the feedbacks we got, we focused on making the webpage clean and correct, and on the responsivness.

We also had a lot of work to do on changing the links, to use relative links instead of static links, because we used a **LOT** of them. 
Same for the images, as our website uses a ton of them, especially in the catalog part.

We also changed the whole CSS system, as we had a CSS file for each page. We now have only one CSS file for the main page style and format (navigation bar, footer, etc), and separated CSS files for each page for the content, that differs from one to another.

## Bug fixing
When reviewing our code, we found that some little improvements could be done on some parts, and some lines, especially in the CSS file where not working, or not working the way we wanted.
We thus fixed some bugs, refined some features, so that the user experience is as fluid as possible.

We also made sure that no errors appeared when giving the files to a validation website.
